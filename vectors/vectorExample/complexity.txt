In regards to the Vector library, the complexity is constant 
for the default constructor (1), and for the move constructors (5) (unless
alloc is different from x's allocator). For all other cases the complexity is linear
in the resulting container size. Additionally, if InputIterator in the range constructor (3) is not at least of a forward iterator category, the new capacity cannot be determined beforehand and the construction incurs in additional logarithmic complexity in size (reallocations while growing).
